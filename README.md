# online-certifications

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my self-motivated, curiosity-driven, hands-on development in data science, which I attempt to classify with the aid of the following Venn diagram. Specifically, my goal is the mastery of artificial intelligence and its myriad derivatives from a technical perspective, so this will be an ever-evolving endeavor.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the conception of this publication and its structure are derived from Mr. Jon Ting's [repository](https://github.com/Jon-Ting/coursera-certifications#a-computer-science). Moreover, I owe a debt of gratitude to the following instructors, each of whom has played a crucial role in shaping my skills: Mr. Ari Anastassiou, Mr. Snehan Kekre, Mr. Ryan Ahmed, Ms. Leire Ahedo, Mr. Amit Yadav, Mr. Andrew Ng, and Mr. Laurence Moroney.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a possibility that the classification of certain certificates may be inaccurate. Likewise, the subdivision of specific areas could inaccurate or redundant. Should you have any insights or recommendations for improvement in either of these aspects, I would greatly appreciate your input.
